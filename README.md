# llm-kubectl

I developed and deployed a custom large language model (LLM) by training it on my own dataset in CSV format. The model was containerized using Docker, enabling seamless deployment and scalability across different environments. I then orchestrated the deployment using Kubernetes, ensuring high availability and efficient resource management. This project showcases my expertise in both AI/ML model development and modern DevOps practices, including containerization and orchestration, while emphasizing practical applications of LLMs tailored to specific datasets.
